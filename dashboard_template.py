    The **Amazon Phone Data dataset** contains real-time information about 340 phone products available on Amazon. It includes prices, reviews, sales volume, and tags such as Best Seller and Amazon Choice. This data is useful for analyzing price trends, forecasting sales volume, and gaining insights into e-commerce.

    For each product in the Amazon Phone Data dataset, several features are measured: asin (Amazon Standard Identification Number), product_title (name of the product), product_price (current price of the product), and product_star_rating (rating given to the product based on customer reviews). This dataset is useful for analyzing product performance, pricing strategies, and consumer preferences in e-commerce. The dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by the user shreyasur965.

    **Content**
    The dataset has **340** rows containing attributes related to phone products on Amazon. The columns include information such as Price, Reviews, Sales Volume, and Tags (e.g., Best Seller, Amazon Choice).

    The results from `df.describe()` highlights the descriptive statistics about the dataset. The product_star_rating has an average rating of 4.09 out of 5, with a standard deviation of 0.38, indicating that most products are rated positively, close to 4 or above. The product_num_ratings column shows an average of 2,744 ratings per product, though a large standard deviation (7,331.82) suggests high variability; while some products have very few ratings, others are extremely popular with many reviews (up to 64,977). product_num_offers averages around 8 offers per product, but again, there's substantial variability (ranging from 1 to 83), suggesting certain products are offered by many vendors. The unit_count column, with only four recorded values, suggests missing data, limiting its usefulness for analysis.

    Overall, these statistics highlight a need for further data cleaning, particularly in handling missing values in unit_count and potentially examining outliers in product_num_ratings and product_num_offers for better consistency in analysis.
